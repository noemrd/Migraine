					According to migraineresearchfoundation.org, 4 million adults experience chronic daily migraines.
				Chronic migraine is the 6th most disabling illness in the world. These throbbing headaches accompanied
				with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound and other neurological symptoms
				could be caused by many different factors. Though there are medications to help relieve the discomfort of
				migraines, there is no known cure.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="aboutUsMessage">
				It is known that certain foods and activities can either trigger the onset of a migraine, or make an
				existing attack worst. These triggers vary from person to person and can be identified by the sufferer with
				careful migraine record keeping and analysis. Identifying individual triggers and avoiding them can help
				reduce the frequency, severity and duration of a migraine.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="aboutUsMessage">
				This project will help users by facilitating the tracking and analysis of their migraines by enabling
				them to input various amount of data through a database backed website. After various migraine entries,
				our system will be able to identify the most common potential triggers.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="aboutUsMessage">
				Through this website, we intend to help migraine sufferers by providing
				them a well optimized and user friendly website that allows them to track their possible triggers of
				migraines. By finding the triggers, we hope that the users are able to alleviate their day to day migraine
				attacks.
